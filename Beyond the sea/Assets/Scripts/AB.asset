  - Living on a tropical island is nice but the lack of facilities makes it rough.
  - We should repurpose any debris from the shipwreck.
  - Do you know how radios work? Not many people do.
  - Should I make fish stew tonight? I'm kind of sick of it.
  - If everyone focused on their own task, we'd be more efficient.
  - Don't sweat the small stuff. Just focus on your what's important.
