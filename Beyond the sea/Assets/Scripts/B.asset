  - Wanna go chase the seagulls? It's pretty fun.
  - That storm was crazy! Wouldn't mind riding that again.
  - It'll cost ya extra fish if you want my help with the tower.
  - I'm taking an extra long coconut juice break.
  - No matter what others say, don't give into "pier" pressure.
  - Catch any big ones? Let me have first dibs if you do.
